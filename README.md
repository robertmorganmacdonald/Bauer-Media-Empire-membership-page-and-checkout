# Bauer-Media-Empire-membership-page-and-checkout

This project changed the design and the functionality of the membership and checkout pages. The 'rolled out' files are png's of the designs I created in the INDD document (membership page changes_v2.indd) and they increment based on the user journey. The project also required prototypes and they were created in XD (ened to end empire.xd and UX journey for membership page.xd).
